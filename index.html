<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
<h2>I am a typical student, just like anyone else. After completing my 10th grade, I chose to study the PCMC combination. Unfortunately, due to the focus on preparing for JEE, I did not have the opportunity to study computer-related subjects. Therefore, I had no prior coding experience before starting my first year of engineering.During my first semester, I learned coding languages such as C and Python from my college, and HTML and CSS from online courses. After completing my first semester,during holidays I challenged my coding knowledge by creating a small website. Although the website may not have been the best, it was a great opportunity for me to apply the coding concepts I learned and to enhance my skills!!
